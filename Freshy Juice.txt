create a list of start and destination nodes. EX:BTB>SR = 21, BTB>K-Cham = 50, BTB>PP = 40
Begin by first start node, than next start node
choose the cheepest arc than the second cheapest arc
  compare supply and capacity
    if supply more than capacity 
        send to fullfit capacity.
    else if supply lesson than capacity 
        send all the supply
    deduct the capacity by the number that we sent
    multiply that to the weight of arc and store in a new Total variable
Return the Total variable
