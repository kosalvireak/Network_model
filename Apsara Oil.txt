Algorithm                                                   Test

Create a list of nodes and arcs.                            0>1 = 6, 0>4 = 4, 1>3 = 3....3>5 = 6, 4>5 = 4
For start node connect to all the connected node.           0-1 and 0-2
Send all the value in, assign value to that nodes           node1 = 6, node2 = 4
Then for normal node,                                       1,2,3 & 4
    compare value and value out                             For node1, value = 6, value out 3+2 = 5    
    send the smaller one to connected nodes.                Since value out = 5 , send 5 to connected node node3 & node4
    For connected nodes, the small one get value first      node3 > node 4 | 3>2, thus value in is 2 and will assign to node 4
    The big one get remain value                            remain value = value node1 - value node4 = 5 - 2 = 3, assign 3 to node3 
    
                                                            For node2, value = 4, value out 5+2 = 7    
                                                            Since value out = 7 , send 4 to connected node node3 & node4
                                                            node4 > node 2 | 5>2, thus value in is 2 and will assign to node 3
                                                            remain value = value node2 - value node3 = 2 - 2 = 2, assign 2 to node3 
           
sum the received value for the 3rd and 4th node             node3 = 3 + 2 = 5
                                                            node4 = 2 + 2 = 4
    send to the end node and sum, assign sum to node5       3>5 = 5 , 4>5 = 4 node5 = 5 + 9
    return the sum of end node                              node5 = 9              


Algorithm for Apsara Oil.
1. start from the first node
2. connect to the cheapest node first and transfer its weight to that node, then the remain value will send to the expensive node, 
3. select 1 receive node and sum total weight inflow. go to step 2 , repeat until all nodes are selected.
