Create a list of node, which has start(Oil Filed) and end node(Refinery)
Create a list of nodes EX: 0>1 = 6, 0>4 = 4, 1>3 = 3, 1>4 = 2
For start node go to all the node that connected.
Then for normal node, 
  if the in weight is bigger then out weight
    connected to all those node and send all the weight
  else if in weight is smaller then out weight
    connected to all those node and send all weight to the smallest one and the remain weight to the biggest one
sum the received weight for the 3rd and 4th node
    send  to the end node
         if the in weight is bigger then out weight
              send out weight
         else if in weight is smaller then out weight.  
              send in weight
