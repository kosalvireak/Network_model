Create a list of nodes(place to meet and the teacher's house)
for teacher's house make it into the main node 
Create a list of arcs EX: 1-2: 2 , 1-4: 6, 2-5: 7
code run every node in list but one fist, next loop choose next node
    the loop will start from first teacher's house
        code will find the way to connect teacher's house to selected node. 
        EX: selected node is number 5, 1-2 : 4, 1-4: 3 , 4-5: 2 , so weight is 1-4 & 4-5 = 5
        return the smallest value
        change the first teacher to second teacher, do this until all are done
    return the smallest weight of each loop
