algorithm>>
create a list of nodes and its supply/demand
create a list of arcs between node 1 by 1, EX: 1>2 = 30, 1>4 = 40
start by demand node
    find the nearest node wih the lowest cost
    send the goods to fullfil that node
    next: find the second cheap node and send to goods to that node
    delete received nodes from above list
check the remain nodes in list
compare the distance between remained node and supplier
take the remain goods in the closest supplier to fullfil that node
    if the node still need more goods, take from the second closest supplier
